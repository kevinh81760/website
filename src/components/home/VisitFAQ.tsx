      "Can I order from BurgerBots if I have special dietary requirements?",

      "Absolutely! We have delicious vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. And if you're allergic to something? We gotchu'. Just chat with one of our humans before ordering or pop a note in your online order. Easy peasy, extra cheesy!",
  },
  {
    question: "Is everything freshly stocked and prepared?",
    answer:
      "Man, we're obsessed with freshness. In fact, that's the whole point of this (gestures around). Every part of your burger is prepped with quality ingredients. We're talking the lettuce, the onions, the tomatoes, all of it gets the VIP treatment, sliced, diced, and prepped right in front of you in real time. We also restock B.O.B's goods several times a day, so no leftovers are sitting around for hours. (Ew.)",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I watch my burger be made, or is that just weird?",
    answer:
      "You sure can! (To be honest, we'd be kinda bummed out if you didn't.) Unlike other automated burger machines, we don't gatekeep what's inside. B.O.B. is encased in crystal clear glass, so you can watch the whole process from garnish to plate right before your eyes. (Not gonna lie, it's pretty dope.) Just ask one of our friendly servers to let you know when your burger is being made and head over to the shiny Bot in the corner to watch the magic roll out.",
